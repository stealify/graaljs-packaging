# graaljs-packaging
Will supply needed infrastructure to install graaljs+graalvm like nodejs
with optional options

# Goals
- install graaljs on bare bone
- use it via docker (is maybe already covered needs tutorials)
- use it as dependency inside es4x stack also form it out of the existing es4x stack


# Why?
This is part of the stealify project which is an effort to create a general development framework based on Enterprise Patterns for Software Development using JavaScript as the Main Highlevel Scripting Langugage
This is largly based on and inspired by the es4x Project that was the first PoC. Thanks for that Amazing Project!
